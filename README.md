Parts of codes in this project is based on the solid solid work of [Pano](https://github.com/louisqw/PanoProject) and [Plato](https://github.com/federerjiang/Plato). Our scheme is inspired by those two papers to apply JND and reinforcement learning in VR streaming.
Our optical flow estimation take the advantage of the state-of-the-art real-time optical flow detection model [FlowNet2.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch).
Tanks to the selflessness and contribution of above mentioned projects. We won't be able to achieve this project without them.
